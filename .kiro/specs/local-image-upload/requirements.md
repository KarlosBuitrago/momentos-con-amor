# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables administrators to upload product images directly from their local computer instead of requiring external URLs. The system will provide a file picker dialog for selecting images (PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, WebP) and automatically handle the upload process using the existing smart image upload service that chooses between Firebase Storage and Base64 encoding based on availability and file size.
